# A Three-Dimensional Hydrogeologic Framework Model of Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System

This web interface allows users to explore a 3-D geologic framework model developed for the Columbia Plateau regional aquifer system as part of a USGS assessment of groundwater availability. The geologic model consists of geologic units with their associated thickness and elevations. The subsurface geology represented in the geologic model can be viewed by two methods: 1) drawing graphic "well logs" at any site, or 2) building complete cross-sections between multiple sites. See the "General Instructions" tab for details.

For more information about the geologic model construction and accuracy of the displayed surfaces, please refer to Burns and others (2010).
