  This web interface allows users to explore a 3-D geologic framework model
  developed for the Columbia Plateau regional aquifer system as part of a USGS assessment of groundwater
  availability. The geologic model consists of geologic units with their
  associated thickness and elevations. The subsurface geology represented in the geologic model
  can be viewed by two methods: 1) drawing graphic "well logs" at any site, or
  2) building complete cross-sections between multiple sites. See the "General Instructions" tab for details.
