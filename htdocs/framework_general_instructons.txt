  <b>Well logs</b>: Click on any location with the extent of the geomodel and a graphic well log will appear
  showing the model derived estimates of geologic units and thicknesses at that location. Select the well
  log information tab to see elevations of the tops of each unit. Select the Framework information tab
  to see general location information. Error estimates for these predicited elevations are described
