  <b>Well log</b>: A graphic well log was derived from estimates of geologic units
  and thicknesses at this specified location in the 3-D geologic framework model
  developed for the Columbia Plateau regional aquifer system as part of a USGS
  assessment of groundwater availability. The well log information is tabulated to
  show values for tops and bottoms, elevations, and thicknesses of each of the geologic
  unit in the accompanying table. Error estimates for these predicited
  elevations are described by
